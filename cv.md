**About me:** The main goal at the moment for me is to find my favorite job and create all the conditions so that my work brings me pleasure. 
I already managed the first part, after several years of searching, I tried myself in many things and I am sure that web development is mine. 
It remains only to fulfill the second part of the goal - to create conditions. 
Therefore, now I am as focused as possible on gaining experience and knowledge in front-end development.
